## Unity version

![](images/unity1.png)

The Unity version was entirely created inside Unity itself, for assets placement, materials configuration, light placement,... The only custom code required was for the camera: Unity provides a camera rotating around a pivot, but with no way to move the camera closer or farther from the pivot, within a range of values.

The default Unity material parameters are now designed for a physically-based rendering setup, so the additional effects map for each object was tweaked to obtain approximate specular maps. Also, Unity provides a parallax mapping material, here applied on the ground.
